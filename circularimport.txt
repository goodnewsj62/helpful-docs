just incase you want to add a module outside your workin directory somewhere
else to your current script without import you could esaily do that by adding
the file path to the directory containing the .py file to sys.path 
import sys
sys.path.appen("_file/path_")

or you could add it to PYTHONPATH env vatriable for linux ~/.bashrc

you could also import a module this way with the help of sys module if it is causing a circular import
issue

sys.module["folder.module"]
