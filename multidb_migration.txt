backup everything just in case!
rename your migrations folder to something else (i.e. migrations-old)
run flask db init --multidb
copy the contents of migrations-old/versions/* to migrations/versions.
run flask db stamp head (this marks the additional databases as being updated)
delete migrations-old

sqllite does not support drop so if you ever want to do something like that and got an error in the versions file do:
with op.batch_alter_table('token_shortner') as batch_op:
        batch_op.drop_column('user_id')
        batch_op.drop_column('post_id')

if only working with sqllite do:
if db.engine.url.drivername == 'sqlite':
        migrate.init_app(app, db, render_as_batch=True)
    else:
        migrate.init_app(app, db)
